PROBLEM: Random 12x12 square of maze floor shows up where it should be grey
         Rather than a 12x12 grey block like the rest of the undiscovered screen, 
         I am getting a 12x12 block that shows maze floor surrounded by the grey.
         Doesn't seem to apply for level 1 (or maybe it occurs outside viewable screen)

SOLUTION: I thought I had to save my old x and y pixels, so I did so, but only for one (x,y) 
          coordinate which I then used as inputs to my second calling of the draw_full_block
          function. This seemed to save this pixel and redraw it somewhere random on screen
          during the next level. It didn't seem to occur during the first level as I had saved
          the (x,y) coordinate in within the redraw if statement after level 1 had occured.

PROBLEM: Screen tearing when after adding thread and running mazegame
FIXED: 3/7/22
SOLUTION: I had printk statements which then affected what the buffer ws trying to write
          and caused strange glitching.

PROBLEM: After writing thread and calling ioctl buttons, I am able to control the player with the
         emulator, but duplicate values of my player are made everytime a turn is made
FIXED: 3/7/22
SOLUTION: I was saving the previous button press ass well as the current one so all button presses
          were showing as sepearate players as the game went on
